Pixel icon pack
https://just-a-cookie.itch.io/pixel-icon-pack

License:
It is a small pack of 48 pixel icons, which includes a bunch of pixel emojis,
control buttons, and a few misc icons. All of the icons are 16x16 pixels.
You may use these assets in your games, programs, apps, etc. If you want,
you may even credit me in your creation, but that's totally optional. :)
